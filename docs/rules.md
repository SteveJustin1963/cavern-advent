# Codex Rules

- Always use yarn.
- Prefer TypeScript with strict options enabled for new code.
- Keep source under `src/` with clear separation of engine/core and adapters.
- Add or update Jest tests alongside new helper or logic changes.
- Avoid destructive git commands; never revert user changes without request.
- Default to ASCII in files unless existing content requires otherwise.
